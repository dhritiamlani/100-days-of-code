# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did the "Basic HTML and HTML5" and "Basic CSS" courses under the "Responsive Web Design" certification on freecodcamp.org again to brush up on my basics.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited and I want be able to start creating as soon as I'm done brushing up the basics. It'll take time to get to a certain level, but it's all going to be worth it at the end. My plant took half a month to grow a leaf. It worked so hard to reach at a point where it's growth could be visible. I'm going to work hard too! :seedling:

### Day 1: March 28, 2021 (updated log on April 2, 2021)

**Today's Progress**: Completed 75% of the "Applied Visual Design" course under the "Responsive Web Design" certification on freecodcamp.org

**Thoughts:** I had always wanted to learn how to turn div tags into cool doodles. I could finally get a start to it. Can't wait to create more.


### Day 2: March 30, 2021 (updated log on April 2, 2021)

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Applied Visual Design" course under the "Responsive Web Design" certification on freecodcamp.org

**Thoughts:** Little confused with the cubic-bezier function but it will get better as I keep using these concepts and creating.


### Day 3: March 31, 2021 (updated log on April 2, 2021)

**Today's Progress**: Read some articles on basic css images and made re-created the crescent moon and the heart on my own. I also made a holographic heart and a triangle. I attempted to animate the colours in the holographic heart but could't. I need to properly learn css animation concepts and then I'll get back to it.

**Thoughts:**  Tiny progress but still makes me happy. Can't wait to get to the project part and create more css images along the way. I'm just so fascinated by whoever thought about using css to such a creative extent.

### Day 4: April 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Applied Accessibility" course under the "Responsive Web Design" certification on freecodcamp.org


**Thoughts:**  I learnt a lot of tiny details that I wasn't aware of, that could cause discomfot to the visually impaired, deaf and the colorblind. It's pretty high priority but it's just briefly mentioned at college and that's it. I hope that could be changed. I'll make sure I focus on accessibility first before I go for the visuals.

### Day 5: April 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Responsive Web Design Principles" and "CSS Flexbox" courses under the "Responsive Web Design" certification on freecodcamp.org


**Thoughts:**  Flex-box, life-saver, same thing!! I only have CSS Grid left now and then I can finally work on the projects ^=^


### Day 6: April 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "CSS Grid" course under the "Responsive Web Design" certification on freecodcamp.org


**Thoughts:**  CSS Grid is cool but I like flexbox more.


### Day 7: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the "Responsive Web Design - Tribute Page" project. 

**Thoughts:**  This is fun!!


### Day 8: April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the "Responsive Web Design - Tribute Page" project.  

**Thoughts:**  The person I am making the tribute page for does not have that big of a timeline. He is pretty young. Just a year older to me. But the amount of things he has done in that time is very admirable.


### Day 9: April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished working on the "Responsive Web Design - Tribute Page" project.  

**Thoughts:**  The person I have made this tribute page for, his name is Angad Daryani. Very underated in my opinion. The amount of things he has done with the time in his life is no joke. I admire him for his passion for solving real problems, his drive. His timeline reminds me of what Elon Musk had said. That if you work harder than everybody else you'll feel like you're ahead in time. This guy is ahead in time, and it's very admirable.
I took a lotttt of time sorting everything in his timeline. I ended up making an excel sheet of his timeline and that made things a lot easier. It's finally done. Even though it's a tiny project I put in a lot of time. I've worked hard. I'll try to work hard and smart!
